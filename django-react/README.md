# Tornado + Polymer for web5 conference

**A basic comment list + comment form updated through AJAX.**

`Django` (Python) is serving JSON data with very basic persistence.
`React` (JavaScript) is dealing with form and list rendering through 
reusable Shadow DOM-like elements.

## Usage

    $ pip install -r requirements.txt
    $ python manage.py runserver
    go to http://localhost:8000/
    populate the form and enjoy!
    (open 2 browsers for some self-trolling)
